# htmlCSSJSPractice
It is a web page of a practice of the subject of the distance university of Spain (Uned) called "Introduction to network programming".

In this web page I have used only css, html5 and javascript not using jQuery or other javascript framework.
Everything has been made from scratch except some css that has been obtained from the internet.
